# Airline Passenger Forecasting using Linear Regression

## Introduction
The project focuses on leveraging historical air travel data to forecast future passenger trends using advanced statistical techniques, particularly Linear Regression. By analyzing past trends and patterns, I aim to provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making in the aviation industry. Anticipating future passenger numbers is essential for airlines to optimize flight schedules, allocate resources efficiently, and plan for future expansions. With this approach I strive to empower airlines with accurate predictions, enabling them to stay ahead in an ever-evolving industry landscape.

### Importance
Anticipating future trends is crucial for strategic decision-making. Airlines rely on these predictions for operational and strategic decisions such as flight scheduling, capacity planning, resource allocation, and strategic expansions.

## Introduction to Linear Regression
Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between dependent and independent variables. In our context, we predict the number of passengers based on time (years or months).

## Quality of Fit: The R-Squared Statistic
The R-squared statistic measures how well the regression equation explains the variance in the dependent variable. A value closer to 1 indicates a better fit. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our linear regression model in forecasting future trends in airline passenger traffic.

## Future Predictions
Once the model is validated, we can predict future passenger traffic.

## Conclusion
In this project, I used Linear Regression to predict future trends in the airline industry. By understanding the fundamentals of linear regression, applying Python's sklearn library, and interpreting the R-squared statistic, I was able to make accurate predictions about future passenger numbers. These skills are invaluable in decision-making processes across various industries.
